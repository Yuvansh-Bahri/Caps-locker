# Caps-locker
Capslocker is a small program that repeatedly turns capslock on and off until a specific code is entered. It's designed to be a small prank extension for days like April Fool's Day, etc. This program does not actually cause any damage; any issues with the caps lock led can be resolved with a computer restart. Enjoy!
